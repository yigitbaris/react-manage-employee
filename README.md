## Manage static employees information

I use these react concepts in the project :

• function based component
• context API
• hooks ( useState , useEffect , useRef)
• Modal , Alert , Button component
• props drilling

This app provide you to add , change and delete employee information. Necessary functions are called from context API.
App has a pagination system too. It worked dynamically with some variable and states information.
